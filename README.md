//Alperen Ekinci, 2024 Hacettepe University Term Project I, RStick Project, Prototyping and Showcasing By Developing The Game S.T.R.I.D.E.R

In a gaming landscape dominated by traditional control devices such as keyboards, mice and gamepads, a new cost-effective method to elevate player immersion is needed. This project intends to design and implement a handheld device called R-Stick, a motion and key-press controlled Bluetooth device.


This repository includes:

* RStick - Component Selection

Using off the shelf products such as HC-05 Bluetooth Module, ADXL345 Accelerometer and
cheap 3D printed parts, greatly reduces the cost of this prototype.But in a future where this
becomes a consumer product its cost can be reduced by creating custom PCBs and cheaper
casing
	-1x Arduino Nano
	-1x Bluetooth Module -> HC05(Has both Slave/Master) for future on-device feedback capability.
	-2x Accelerometer -> ADXL345
	-6x Small buttons, one for thumb action one for calibration and 4 for remaining fingers
	-1x 9V Battery
	-Connector cables
	-1 Breadboard, to connect everything together.
	-3D Printed connectors, component holders, protective casing and handle

* RStick - Body 3D Design/Print/Assembly

* RStick - Driver Code

* S.T.R.I.D.E.R - Showcase Build (Also playable with keyboard - mouse)
